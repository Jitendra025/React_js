-------------------Setting up CSS Module------------------------
1. Why we need to setup CSS Module
CSS Modules let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes.
for example

Button.module.css.. this file has a class .error
.error {
  background-color: red;
}

another style has same error class
another-stylesheet.css
.error {
  color: red;
}

using both style sheet those have same class name (thoug doing different bit)
Button.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styles from './Button.module.css'; // Import css modules stylesheet as styles
import './another-stylesheet.css'; // Import regular stylesheet
class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // reference as a js object
    return <button className={styles.error}>Error Button</button>; // see here we have passed {styles.error}. we have imported Button.module.css as styles so here we specify to                          
                                                                   // use .error class of ./Button.module.css
  }
}

We can import stylesheet like below only when css module is setup:
import styles from './Button.module.css'; 

How to setup css module in the project
Steps:
1. Open the project in the visual studio code and the open terminal
2. run command npm run eject
3. This will add one config folder in the project
4. Go to config folder and find webpack.config.dev.js and open
5. Find the section in the config file saying test:/\.css$/ and lader is set as loader: require.resolve('css-loader') and not 'style-loader'
6. The under the options object add below after importLoaders:1
    modules:true,
    localIdentName:'[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]'  // here [name] will bre replcaed with the css class name, local is componenet name in which css class used and rest is hash function for that
                                                      // This will generated the unque class name to avoid clashes of same name in different css files
7 Do the same in the webpack.config.prod.js

8. As due to some reason or the higher version of react 16.13 I am using the above changes does work and importing CSS class does not work actually after enabling css module.
9. I googled it ans found out that we can give the name of css file by adding .module in between for example Layout.module.css and that worked for me.
So in the project each css file will have .module in file name. Possibly changing dev and prod coonfig not needed in higher version of react to enable css modules.
